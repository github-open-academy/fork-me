# How to add your curated lessons to Odemy?

1. Fork this repo.
2. Rename the repository name. Repo name will serve as the title of the curation.
3. Edit the README.md file. This will be displayed as introduction when someone is viewing at your curated lessons.
4. Edit playlist.json according to your course's playlist. For now, only Youtube videos are supported so please use video id as ytId.
5. That's it!
